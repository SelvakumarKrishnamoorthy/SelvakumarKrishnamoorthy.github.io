**Why does #Apple always come up with three versions of #iPhone?**

Let's understand this by an example.

Let's say you are an ice-cream lover. You find great value in eating ice-cream.

One fine day, you are out to treat yourself. Shopkeeper provides you below options:

One Scoop Ice Cream: 13 bucks
Two Scoop Ice Cream: 19 bucks
Three Scoop Ice Cream: 19.5 bucks

The negligible difference between the prices of 2nd and 3rd options gets your attention.

This is called #Decoy Effect.

A 2nd option is just a Decoy option. Companies provide decoy option so that #customer can compare Decoy option with an expensive option.

In the absence of a decoy option, the customer will compare: 13 bucks vs 19.5 bucks - and may probably go with a #cheaper option.

But with decoy option, the customer now compares 19 bucks vs 19.5 bucks - and most likely selects the #expensive option.

Can you see a similar pattern in the pricing of iphone11 by Apple?

iPhone: $ 699
iPhone Pro: $ 999
iPhone Pro max: $ 1099

Yes, Apple does use Decoy effect to drive #consumer to buy the expensive version of their product. Not only they are making quality products, but also they are not leaving any stone unturned when it comes to #marketing and #selling their products.
